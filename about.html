    <h1>About G.L.O.E.W</h1>
    <p>
      G.L.O.E.W is a trauma-informed sisterhood space for young women
      who are ready to heal, grow, and step into the soft, stable lives they deserve.
    </p>

  <!-- OUR HEART -->
  <section class="section-narrow">
    <div class="section-pill">Our heart</div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Why G.L.O.E.W exists</h2>

    <p class="section-lead">
      G.L.O.E.W was created from lived experience, as a response to the gaps many young women
      fall through when it comes to healing, safety, confidence, and real-life opportunities.
    </p>

    <div class="section-grid" style="margin-top: 18px;">
      <div class="card-soft">
        <span class="pill-mini">For the girl who…</span>
        <h3>Has survived more than she’s ever said out loud.</h3>
        <p>
          We hold space for young women who may have experienced domestic abuse, sexual violence,
          emotional harm, unstable relationships, or childhood trauma and who are now ready to
          move from surviving to slowly, gently thriving.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-soft">
        <span class="pill-mini">We believe…</span>
        <h3>You shouldn’t have to heal alone.</h3>
        <p>
          Healing is hard, and it’s even harder in isolation. G.L.O.E.W is a sisterhood:
          a community where women can breathe, unpack, laugh, cry, and rebuild together,
          supported by trauma-informed practice and real tools.

    <h2 class="section-title">Our core values</h2>

    <div class="section-grid">
      <div class="card-soft">
        <span class="pill-mini">Safety</span>
        <h3>Emotional + physical safety first.</h3>
        <p>
          We prioritise consent, confidentiality, boundaries and emotional check-ins.
          No one is pushed to share more than they want to. Every woman’s story is held with respect.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-soft">
        <span class="pill-mini">Dignity</span>
        <h3>You are more than what happened to you.</h3>
        <p>
          We see every woman as whole, not broken. The focus is on strengths,
          resilience and the future, not just the pain.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-soft">
        <span class="pill-mini">Sisterhood</span>
        <h3>No one left behind.</h3>
        <p>
          We build honest, supportive relationships where women uplift each other,
          challenge harmful patterns, and practice community care.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-soft">
        <span class="pill-mini">Growth</span>
        <h3>Small steps count.</h3>
        <p>
          We celebrate small wins: a boundary set, a red flag noticed, a CV updated,
          a poem performed. Progress is both emotional and practical.
